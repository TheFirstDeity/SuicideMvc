#### [Project Page][project]

## Summary
Suicide MVC is a lightweight, open-source RAD framework for building websites in PHP. Originally for use in a school project at [SAIT Polytechnic](http://www.sait.ca/), the intention was to sharpen my PHP programming skills by building a lightweight MVC framework from scratch. Suicide MVC is loosely inspired by [CakePHP](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp).
