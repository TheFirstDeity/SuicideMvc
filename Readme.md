## Summary
Suicide MVC is a lightweight, open-source RAD framework for building websites in PHP. Originally for use in a school project at [SAIT Polytechnic](http://www.sait.ca/), the intention was to sharpen my PHP programming skills by building a lightweight MVC framework from scratch. Suicide MVC was inspired by [CakePHP](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp).

#### Current Version: 0.1 Alpha
New software repository, in development and not ready for release.
